# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up Go project structure with modules and dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize Go module, set up directory structure (cmd/, pkg/, internal/), and install core dependencies (go-ethereum, gqlgen, PostgreSQL driver, Redis client, Prometheus client)
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Go module and create basic project structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the Go module with proper naming and create the standard directory structure including cmd/, pkg/, and internal/ folders.
### Details:
Run 'go mod init' with appropriate module name, create the directory structure following Go project conventions (cmd/ for entry points, pkg/ for public packages, internal/ for private implementation), and set up a basic .gitignore file for Go projects.

## 2. Install go-ethereum dependency and set up Ethereum client interfaces [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Add go-ethereum as a dependency and create the necessary interfaces for interacting with Ethereum networks.
### Details:
Run 'go get github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum', create interface definitions for Ethereum client interactions in internal/ethereum/, and implement basic connection configuration for both mainnet and testnet environments.

## 3. Install and configure GraphQL dependencies with gqlgen [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up gqlgen for GraphQL API development including schema definition and resolver structure.
### Details:
Run 'go get github.com/99designs/gqlgen', initialize gqlgen with 'go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen init', create a basic schema.graphqls file with placeholder types, and generate the initial resolver code. Configure gqlgen.yml for the project's specific needs.

## 4. Install and configure database dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Add PostgreSQL driver and set up database connection configuration and basic repository interfaces.
### Details:
Run 'go get github.com/lib/pq' for PostgreSQL driver, create database connection configuration in internal/database/, implement connection pooling, define repository interfaces for data access, and create migration scripts for initial schema setup.

## 5. Install monitoring and caching dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Add Redis client for caching and Prometheus client for metrics collection and configure their basic setup.
### Details:
Run 'go get github.com/go-redis/redis/v8' for Redis client and 'go get github.com/prometheus/client_golang' for Prometheus, create configuration for both in internal/cache/ and internal/metrics/, implement basic client wrappers, and set up health check endpoints for both services.
