# Task ID: 23
# Title: Create validator list page with search and filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Build comprehensive validator list with pagination, search, filter by status, and sort by effectiveness
# Details:
Create paginated validator table (20 per page). Implement search with 300ms debounce. Add status filter dropdown. Implement sorting. Use infinite scroll for pagination. Cache table fragments in Redis (30s TTL). Add mobile card view.

# Test Strategy:
Test search with various queries. Verify filter combinations. Test pagination with 1000+ validators. Load test cached vs uncached performance. Test mobile responsiveness.

Visual Verification (Playwright MCP):
- Capture screenshots at key interaction points
- Establish visual regression baselines for comparison
- Test across viewports: mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px), wide (1920px)
- Verify dark mode rendering (if applicable)
- Test HTMX partial updates (ensure no layout shift or flashing)
- Validate accessibility: focus indicators, color contrast ratios
- Screenshot error states and empty states
- Verify loading states and skeleton screens render correctly
- Use Playwright MCP to navigate, interact, and capture all states
- Store screenshots in tests/visual-regression/baselines/
- Compare against baselines on subsequent runs (fail on >5% diff)
- Screenshot: Validator list (full table)
- Screenshot: Search results (with matches)
- Screenshot: Search results (no matches/empty state)
- Screenshot: Filter dropdown (open/closed)
- Screenshot: Sorted table (by effectiveness, balance, index)
- Screenshot: Pagination controls
- Screenshot: Infinite scroll loading indicator
- Screenshot: Mobile card view (instead of table)
- Screenshot: Loading skeleton during search
- Verify search debounce (no flickering)
- Verify HTMX table updates (smooth swap)
