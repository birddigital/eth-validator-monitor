# Task ID: 26
# Title: Create alerts management page
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 25
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build alerts page with filtering, batch operations, and real-time notifications
# Details:
Display alerts table with filters. Implement batch selection. Create batch actions: mark as read, dismiss. Implement real-time alert toasts via SSE. Add pagination (50 per page). Color-code severity. Show alert badge in navbar.

# Test Strategy:
Test batch operations with 100+ alerts. Verify real-time toasts. Test filter combinations. Test alert badge updates. Accessibility test for toasts.

Visual Verification (Playwright MCP):
- Capture screenshots at key interaction points
- Establish visual regression baselines for comparison
- Test across viewports: mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px), wide (1920px)
- Verify dark mode rendering (if applicable)
- Test HTMX partial updates (ensure no layout shift or flashing)
- Validate accessibility: focus indicators, color contrast ratios
- Screenshot error states and empty states
- Verify loading states and skeleton screens render correctly
- Use Playwright MCP to navigate, interact, and capture all states
- Store screenshots in tests/visual-regression/baselines/
- Compare against baselines on subsequent runs (fail on >5% diff)
- Screenshot: Alerts page (full list)
- Screenshot: Alerts filtered by severity (critical, warning, info)
- Screenshot: Alerts filtered by status (read, unread)
- Screenshot: Batch selection (checkboxes selected)
- Screenshot: Batch action dropdown
- Screenshot: Alert toast notification (real-time)
- Screenshot: Alert badge in navbar (with count)
- Screenshot: Empty state (no alerts)
- Screenshot: Pagination controls
- Verify real-time alert toasts appear smoothly
- Verify batch operations update UI immediately
