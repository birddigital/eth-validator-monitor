# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement dashboard with key metrics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Create main dashboard page displaying overview statistics, recent alerts, top validators with real-time SSE updates
# Details:
Fetch aggregate metrics: total validators, average effectiveness, total balance. Show last 5 alerts. Display top 10 validators. Create system health indicators. Implement SSE endpoint for updates. Use hx-sse for real-time data. Add skeleton loaders.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test metric calculation. Test SSE connection and data push. Verify dashboard renders with no data. Load test 100 concurrent SSE connections. Test SSE reconnection.

Visual Verification (Playwright MCP):
- Capture screenshots at key interaction points
- Establish visual regression baselines for comparison
- Test across viewports: mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px), wide (1920px)
- Verify dark mode rendering (if applicable)
- Test HTMX partial updates (ensure no layout shift or flashing)
- Validate accessibility: focus indicators, color contrast ratios
- Screenshot error states and empty states
- Verify loading states and skeleton screens render correctly
- Use Playwright MCP to navigate, interact, and capture all states
- Store screenshots in tests/visual-regression/baselines/
- Compare against baselines on subsequent runs (fail on >5% diff)
- Screenshot: Dashboard with full data
- Screenshot: Dashboard with empty state (no validators)
- Screenshot: Dashboard with partial data
- Screenshot: Real-time metric updates (before/after SSE event)
- Screenshot: Alert cards (critical, warning, info)
- Screenshot: Top validators table
- Screenshot: System health indicators (all states: healthy, degraded, down)
- Screenshot: Skeleton loaders during initial load
- Verify SSE updates don't cause layout shift
- Test dashboard on all 4 viewports
