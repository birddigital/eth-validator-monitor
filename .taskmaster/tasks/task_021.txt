# Task ID: 21
# Title: Build login and registration pages
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19, 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Create complete login and registration UI with HTMX form handling, validation, and error messaging
# Details:
Design login form with email/password fields. Create registration form. Implement client-side validation (HTML5). Add server-side validation. Use HTMX for form submission without page reload. Display inline error messages. Add loading states.

# Test Strategy:
Test form validation (client and server). Verify HTMX submission prevents page reload. Test error message display. Integration test complete auth flow. Test accessibility of form inputs.

Visual Verification (Playwright MCP):
- Capture screenshots at key interaction points
- Establish visual regression baselines for comparison
- Test across viewports: mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px), wide (1920px)
- Verify dark mode rendering (if applicable)
- Test HTMX partial updates (ensure no layout shift or flashing)
- Validate accessibility: focus indicators, color contrast ratios
- Screenshot error states and empty states
- Verify loading states and skeleton screens render correctly
- Use Playwright MCP to navigate, interact, and capture all states
- Store screenshots in tests/visual-regression/baselines/
- Compare against baselines on subsequent runs (fail on >5% diff)
- Screenshot: Login page (default state)
- Screenshot: Login page (with errors)
- Screenshot: Registration page (default state)
- Screenshot: Registration page (with validation errors)
- Screenshot: Password strength indicator
- Screenshot: Loading state during submission
- Screenshot: Success state (toast notification)
- Verify HTMX form submission (no page reload)
- Verify inline error message positioning
